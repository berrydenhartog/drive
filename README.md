## Getting started 🔧

### Prerequisite

Make sure you have a recent version of Docker and [Docker
Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install) installed on your laptop:

```bash
$ docker -v
  Docker version 27.5.1, build 9f9e405

$ docker compose version
  Docker Compose version v2.32.4
```

> ⚠️ You may need to run the following commands with `sudo` but this can be
> avoided by assigning your user to the `docker` group.

### Bootstrap project

The easiest way to start working on the project is to use GNU Make:

```bash
$ make bootstrap
```

This command builds the `app-dev` container, installs dependencies, performs
database migrations and compile translations. It's a good idea to use this
command each time you are pulling code from the project repository to avoid
dependency-related or migration-related issues.

Your Docker services should now be up and running! 🎉

Note that if you need to run them afterward, you can use the eponym Make rule:

```bash
$ make run
```

You can check all available Make rules using:

```bash
$ make help
```

### Django admin

You can access the Django admin site at
[http://localhost:8071/admin](http://localhost:8071/admin).

You first need to create a superuser account:

```bash
$ make superuser
```

You can then login with sub `admin@example.com` and password `admin`.


### Run frontend

#### Locally
To run the frontend locally :

`cd src/frontend/ && yarn && yarn build-theme && yarn dev`

#### With Docker

Run the front with:

```bash
$ make run-with-frontend
```

Then access [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with :
user: drive
password: drive
