# Installation
If you want to install Drive you've come to the right place.

For now we only have a documentation to install it on Kubernetes. We will more than happy to improve this documentation with other methods.

Feel free to make a PR to add ones that are not listed after üôè

## Kubernetes
We (Drive maintainers) are only using the Kubernetes deployment method in production. We can only provide advanced support for this method.
Please follow the instructions laid out [here](/docs/installation/kubernetes.md).
